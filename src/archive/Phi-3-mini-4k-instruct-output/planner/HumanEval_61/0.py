def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    Return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets.
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
        a. If the character is an opening bracket ("("), push it onto the stack.
        b. If the character is a closing bracket (")"), check if the stack is empty:
            - If the stack is empty, return False (unbalanced brackets).
            - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack (an opening bracket).
    3. After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty:
        - If the stack is empty, return True (balanced brackets).
        - If the stack is not empty, return False (unbalanced brackets).
    4. Consider edge cases, such as an empty input string or a string with only one character.
    5. Return the result indicating whether the brackets are correctly bracketed or not.
