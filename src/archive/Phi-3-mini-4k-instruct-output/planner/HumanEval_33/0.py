def sort_third(l: list) -> list:
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Args:
    l (list): The input list.

    Returns:
    list: A new list with the same values as the input list at indicies not divisible by three, and the sorted values at indicies divisible by three.

    Example:
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
