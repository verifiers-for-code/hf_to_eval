def digits(n):
    """Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.
    Return 0 if all digits are even.

    Args:
    n (int): A positive integer.

    Returns:
    int: The product of the odd digits in n, or 0 if all digits are even.

    Action Plan:
    1. Convert the input number `n` to a string to easily access each digit.
    2. Initialize a variable `product` to store the product of odd digits, set it to 1 (since 1 is the multiplicative identity).
    3. Iterate through each character (digit) in the string representation of `n`:
        a. Convert the character back to an integer.
        b. Check if the integer is odd (using the modulus operator `%`).
        c. If the digit is odd, multiply the `product` by the digit.
    4. After iterating through all digits, check if the `product` is still 1:
        a. If `product` is 1, it means all digits were even, so return 0.
        b. Otherwise, return the `product` as the result.
    5. Consider edge cases, such as an input of 0 or a negative number.

    Note: Use appropriate string and integer operations to manipulate the digits.
    Be careful with the logic for checking odd digits and updating the product.
