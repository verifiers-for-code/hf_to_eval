def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right; simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left. Two cars are said to collide when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

    Action Plan:
    1. Understand the problem:
        - There are two sets of n cars, one moving left to right and the other moving right to left.
        - Cars move at the same speed and are infinitely sturdy.
        - A collision occurs when a car moving left to right hits a car moving right to left.

    2. Set up the initial conditions:
        - Initialize a variable to count the number of collisions.
        - Create two lists to represent the positions of the cars in each set.
        - Initialize the positions of the cars in each set to 0.

    3. Iterate through the cars and check for collisions:
        - Use a loop to iterate through the cars in the left-to-right set.
        - For each car in the left-to-right set, check if it collides with any car in the right-to-left set.
        - To check for a collision, compare the positions of the cars in both sets.

    4. Count the number of collisions:
        - If a collision is detected, increment the collision count.

    5. Return the final result:
        - After iterating through all cars, return the total number of collisions.

    Note: Consider the problem's constraints and the infinite sturdiness of the cars when designing the solution.
