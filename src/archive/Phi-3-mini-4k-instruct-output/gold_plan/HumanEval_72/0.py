def will_it_fly(q, w):
    '''
    Write a function that returns True if the object q will fly, and False otherwise.
    The object q will fly if it's balanced (it is a palindromic list) and the sum of its elements is less than or equal the maximum possible weight w.

    Example:
    will_it_fly([1, 2], 5) ➞ False 
    # 1+2 is less than the maximum possible weight, but it's unbalanced.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 1) ➞ False
    # it's balanced, but 3+2+3 is more than the maximum possible weight.

    will_it_fly([3, 2, 3], 9) ➞ True
    # 3+2+3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    will_it_fly([3], 5) ➞ True
    # 3 is less than the maximum possible weight, and it's balanced.

    Action Plan:
    1. Check the weight condition:
       - Calculate the sum of all elements in the list q
       - Compare this sum with the maximum weight w
       - If the sum is greater than w, return False immediately

    2. Check if the list is balanced (palindromic):
       - Initialize two pointers, one at the start and one at the end of the list
       - Compare elements at these pointers, moving towards the center
       - If any pair of elements doesn't match, return False

    3. If both conditions are met:
       - If we've made it through both checks without returning False, return True

    Remember to handle edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with a single element.
