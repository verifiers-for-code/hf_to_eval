def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Define the function `eat` with three parameters: `number`, `need`, and `remaining`.
    2. Initialize a variable `total_eaten` to store the total number of eaten carrots.
    3. Calculate the total number of eaten carrots by adding `number` and `need`.
    4. Check if there are enough remaining carrots to meet the `need`.
        - If there are enough remaining carrots:
            - Subtract `need` from `remaining` to get the number of carrots left.
            - Return a list containing `total_eaten` and the number of carrots left.
        - If there are not enough remaining carrots:
            - Subtract `remaining` from `total_eaten` to get the number of carrots left.
            - Return a list containing `total_eaten` and 0 (since all remaining carrots are eaten).
    5. Return the result as a list of two integers.
    
    Note: Ensure the function handles the case when there are not enough remaining carrots correctly."""
    
    total_eaten = number + need
    if remaining >= need:
        remaining -= need
    else:
        total_eaten -= remaining
        remaining = 0
    return [total_eaten, remaining]
