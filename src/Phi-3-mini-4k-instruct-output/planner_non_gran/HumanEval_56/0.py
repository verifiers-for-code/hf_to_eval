def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets.
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
        a. If the character is an opening bracket ("<"), push it onto the stack.
        b. If the character is a closing bracket (">"), check if the stack is empty:
            - If the stack is empty, return False (mismatched brackets).
            - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack.
    3. After iterating through the entire string, check if the stack is empty:
        - If the stack is empty, return True (all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets).
        - If the stack is not empty, return False (mismatched brackets).
    4. Return the result of the check.
    
    Note: Use a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets.
    Be careful when handling opening and closing brackets to avoid mismatches."""
