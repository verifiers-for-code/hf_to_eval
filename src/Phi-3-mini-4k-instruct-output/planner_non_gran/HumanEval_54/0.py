    Check if two words have the same characters.

    Action Plan:
    1. Understand the problem:
        - Two words have the same characters if they contain the same characters, regardless of their order.
    
    2. Preprocess the input strings:
        - Convert both input strings to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
    
    3. Compare the characters in both strings:
        - Convert both strings to sets to remove duplicates and enable efficient comparison.
        - Compare the sets of characters from both strings.
    
    4. Return the result:
        - If the sets of characters are equal, return True (the words have the same characters).
        - If the sets of characters are not equal, return False (the words do not have the same characters).
    
    Note: Use appropriate string and set operations to implement the comparison.
    Be mindful of the problem's requirements and the need for case-insensitive comparison.
