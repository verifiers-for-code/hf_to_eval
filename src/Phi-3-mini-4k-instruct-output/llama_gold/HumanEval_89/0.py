def encrypt(s):
    """Create a function encrypt that takes a string as an argument and
    returns a string encrypted with the alphabet being rotated. 
    The alphabet should be rotated in a manner such that the letters 
    shift down by two multiplied to two places.
    For example:
    encrypt('hi') returns 'lm'
    encrypt('asdfghjkl') returns 'ewhjklnop'
    encrypt('gf') returns 'kj'
    encrypt('et') returns 'ix'
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Define the original alphabet as a string of lowercase letters.
    2. Initialize an empty string to store the encrypted result.
    3. Iterate through each character in the input string:
       a. Check if the character is a letter in the original alphabet.
       b. If it's a letter, calculate its new position in the alphabet by shifting it down by 2*2 places.
       c. Ensure the new position is within the alphabet range by using a modular operation.
       d. Add the character at the new position to the encrypted result string.
       e. If the character is not a letter, add it to the result string as is.
    4. Return the encrypted result string."""
