def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty flag to track if the string contains any letters.
    2. Initialize an empty result string or a list to store the modified characters.
    3. Iterate through each character in the input string:
       a. Check if the character is a letter using the `isalpha()` method.
       b. If it's a letter, swap its case (from lower to upper or vice versa) and set the flag to 1.
       c. If it's not a letter, keep it as is.
    4. After iterating through the entire string, check the flag.
    5. If the flag is still 0, meaning the string contains no letters, reverse the result string.
    6. Return the resulting string."""
