    """Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary
    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.

    Example:

    Action Plan:
    1. Split the input string into a list of individual letters.
    2. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the letter frequencies.
    3. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum frequency.
    4. Iterate through the list of letters:
       a. Count the occurrences of each letter in the list.
       b. Update the maximum frequency if the count is higher.
    5. Iterate through the list again:
       a. For each letter with the maximum frequency, add an entry to the dictionary with the letter as the key and the frequency as the value.
    6. Return the resulting dictionary.
    7. Handle the edge case: If the input string is empty, return an empty dictionary.
    
    Note: Be mindful of handling the case where multiple letters have the same maximum frequency."""
