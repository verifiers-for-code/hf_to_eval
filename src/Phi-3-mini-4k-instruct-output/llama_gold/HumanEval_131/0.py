def digits(n):
    """Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.
    Return 0 if all digits are even.
    For example:
    digits(1)  == 1
    digits(4)  == 0
    digits(235) == 15
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Convert the input number to a string to easily iterate through its digits.
    2. Initialize a variable to store the product of odd digits, set to 1 (neutral element for multiplication).
    3. Initialize a counter to track the number of odd digits found.
    4. Iterate through each character (digit) in the string:
       a. Convert the character back to an integer for easy parity check.
       b. Check if the digit is odd (i.e., its remainder when divided by 2 is 1).
       c. If the digit is odd, multiply the product by the digit and increment the odd count.
    5. After iterating through all digits, check if no odd digits were found (odd count is 0).
       a. If all digits were even, return 0.
       b. Otherwise, return the calculated product of odd digits."""
