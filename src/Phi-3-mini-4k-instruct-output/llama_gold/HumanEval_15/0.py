    Action Plan:
    1. Understand that the function takes an integer `n` as input and returns a string.
    2. Generate a sequence of numbers from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a looping construct.
    3. Convert each number in the sequence to a string.
    4. Join the string representations of the numbers with a space character in between.
    5. Return the resulting string.
    
    Note: Consider using a range-based looping construct to generate the sequence of numbers."""
