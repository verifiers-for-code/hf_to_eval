def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Understand the problem:
        - There are two sets of n cars moving in opposite directions
        - Cars move at the same speed
        - Cars are infinitely sturdy and strong, so they don't stop or change direction when they collide
        - The goal is to find the number of collisions between cars
    
    2. Set up the variables and data structures:
        - Initialize an empty list to store the positions of the left-moving cars
        - Initialize an empty list to store the positions of the right-moving cars
        - Initialize a variable to count the number of collisions
    
    3. Implement the collision detection logic:
        - Iterate through the positions of the left-moving cars and right-moving cars
        - For each pair of cars, check if they collide (i.e., the difference between their positions is a multiple of the distance between the two sets of cars)
        - If a collision is detected, increment the collision count and update the positions of the cars
    
    4. Handle collisions and update the positions of cars:
        - Update the positions of the cars by adding their speeds to their current positions
        - Continue updating the positions until all cars have collided
    
    5. Calculate the total number of collisions:
        - Return the total number of collisions found
    
    Note: Be careful when implementing the collision detection logic to avoid duplicate collisions.
    Use a data structure that allows efficient insertion and searching of positions."""

    # Initialize the collision count

    for left_position in left_positions:
        for right_position in right_positions:
            # Check if the cars collide
            if (right_position - left_position) % (2*n) == 0:
                # Increment the collision count and update the positions of the cars
                collision_count += 1
                left_positions.remove(left_position)
                right_positions.remove(right_position)
                left_positions.append(left_position + 2*n)
                right_positions.append(right_position - 2*n)
