def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Define the function triples_sum_to_zero that takes a list of integers as input.
    2. Initialize a variable to store the result (True or False).
    3. Generate all possible triplets from the input list using nested loops:
        - Use three nested loops to create all possible combinations of three elements from the list.
        - Ensure that the triplets are distinct by skipping duplicate combinations.
    4. For each triplet, calculate the sum of its elements.
    5. Check if the sum of the current triplet is equal to zero.
    6. If a triplet summing to zero is found, immediately return True.
    7. If no triplet summing to zero is found after checking all combinations, return False.
    8. Consider optimizing the solution by reducing the number of combinations to check.
