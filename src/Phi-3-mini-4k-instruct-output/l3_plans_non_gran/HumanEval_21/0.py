    Given a list of numbers (of at least two elements), apply a linear transform to that list,
    such that the smallest number will become 0 and the largest will become 1.
    
    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the transformed numbers.
    2. Find the minimum and maximum values in the input list using the min and max functions.
    3. Iterate through each number in the input list:
        a. Apply the linear transformation: (number - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)
        b. Add the transformed number to the result list
    4. Return the transformed list.
    
    Note: Ensure the input list has at least two elements.
    Be careful with division by zero when max_value - min_value is zero.
