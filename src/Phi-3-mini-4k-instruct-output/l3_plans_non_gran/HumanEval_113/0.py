    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the output strings.
    2. Iterate through each string in the input list:
        a. Initialize a counter for odd digits in the current string.
        b. Iterate through each character in the current string:
            - Check if the character is a digit using the isdigit() method.
            - If it's a digit, check if it's odd by comparing its ASCII value with the ASCII value of '9'.
            - If it's odd, increment the odd digit counter.
        c. Create the output string with the required format:
            - Use the count of odd digits in the string.
            - Use the original string with the digit counts replaced.
        d. Add the output string to the result list.
    3. Return the list of output strings.
    
    Note: Be careful when replacing digits with their counts in the output strings.
    Use the correct method to count odd digits in each string."""
