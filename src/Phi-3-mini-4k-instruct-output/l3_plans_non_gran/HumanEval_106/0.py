def f(n):
    """Implement the function f that takes n as a parameter,
    and returns a list of size n, such that the value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even
    or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    i starts from 1.
    The factorial of i is the multiplication of the numbers from 1 to i (1 * 2 * ... * i).
    Example:
    f(5) == [1, 2, 6, 24, 15]

    Action Plan:
    1. Understand the problem: The function f takes an integer n as input and returns a list of size n. The value of the element at index i is the factorial of i if i is even, or the sum of numbers from 1 to i otherwise.
    
    2. Create an empty list to store the result: Initialize an empty list of size n to store the final result.
    
    3. Implement the logic for even and odd indices:
        a. Iterate through the range from 1 to n (inclusive).
        b. For each index i:
            - Check if i is even (i % 2 == 0).
            - If i is even, calculate the factorial of i.
            - If i is odd, calculate the sum of numbers from 1 to i.
    
    4. Calculate the factorial for even indices:
        a. Initialize a variable to store the factorial result.
        b. Iterate from 1 to i (inclusive) and multiply the result by each number.
    
    5. Calculate the sum of numbers for odd indices:
        a. Initialize a variable to store the sum result.
        b. Iterate from 1 to i (inclusive) and add each number to the sum.
    
    6. Assemble the final result:
        a. Append the calculated result to the list at index i.
        b. Return the final list.
    
    Note: Be careful with the indexing and calculations to ensure correct results."""
