def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize a variable to store the total number of eaten carrots.
    2. Add the number of remaining carrots to the total eaten carrots.
    3. If the total eaten carrots are less than the number needed, add the difference to the total eaten carrots.
    4. Subtract the total eaten carrots from the remaining carrots to get the remaining carrots after eating.
    5. Return the total eaten carrots and the remaining carrots as an array.
    
    Note: Be careful with the order of operations to avoid errors.
    Consider the constraints on the input variables (number, need, remaining) and ensure the solution stays within these bounds.
