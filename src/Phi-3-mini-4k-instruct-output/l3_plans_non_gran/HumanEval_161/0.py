def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.

    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty string to store the processed characters.
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
        a. Check if the character is a letter using the `isalpha()` method.
        b. If the character is a letter:
            - Use the `swapcase()` method to reverse its case.
        c. If the character is not a letter:
            - Leave it unchanged.
        d. Add the processed character to the result string.
    3. After processing all characters, check if the result string contains any letters:
        a. If the result string contains no letters:
            - Use the `reversed()` function to reverse the entire string.
            - Convert the reversed characters back to a string using the `join()` method.
    4. Return the final processed string."""
