def add(x: int, y: int):
    """Add two numbers x and y
    >>> add(2, 3)
    5
    >>> add(5, 7)
    12
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Define a function named `add` that takes two integer parameters, `x` and `y`.
    2. Inside the function, use the `+` operator to add `x` and `y` together.
    3. Return the result of the addition as an integer.
    4. No need to consider edge cases or potential errors, as addition is a basic operation that can handle all integer inputs.
    
    Note: The function will automatically handle the addition and return the correct result."""
    return x + y
