def special_factorial(n):
    """The Brazilian factorial is defined as:
    brazilian_factorial(n) = n! * (n-1)! * (n-2)! * ... * 1!
    where n > 0

    For example:
    >>> special_factorial(4)
    288

    The function will receive an integer as input and should return the special
    factorial of this integer.
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Define a function `special_factorial` that takes an integer `n` as input.
    2. Initialize a variable `result` to 1, which will store the special factorial.
    3. Iterate through the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
    4. Inside the loop, calculate the factorial of the current number `i` using a nested function `factorial`.
    5. Multiply the `result` by the calculated factorial of `i`.
    6. After the loop, return the final `result` as the special factorial of `n`.
    7. Define a helper function `factorial` to calculate the factorial of a single number `n`.
    8. In the `factorial` function, use a recursive approach to calculate the factorial of `n`.
    9. Handle the base case where `n` is 0 or 1.
    10. Return the calculated factorial.
    
    Note: Consider using a recursive approach for the `factorial` function to simplify the implementation.
    Be careful with the calculation and multiplication to ensure accurate results."""
