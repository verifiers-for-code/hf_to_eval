def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
    
    2. Iterate through each element in the input list with its index:
        a. Check if the index is divisible by three (using the modulus operator `%`).
        b. If the index is divisible by three:
            - Sort the list in ascending order using a sorting function (e.g., `sorted()`).
            - Get the value at the current index from the sorted list.
        c. If the index is not divisible by three:
            - Get the value at the current index from the input list.
        d. Append the obtained value to the result list.
    
    3. After iterating through all elements, return the result list.
    
    Note: Use appropriate list methods for sorting and indexing.
    Be careful with the sorting logic when the index is divisible by three."""
