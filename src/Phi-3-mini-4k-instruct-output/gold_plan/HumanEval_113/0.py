def odd_count(lst):
    """Given a list of strings, where each string consists of only digits, return a list.
    Each element i of the output should be "the number of odd elements in the
    string i of the input." where all the i's should be replaced by the number
    of odd digits in the i'th string of the input.

    Action plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the results.
    2. Iterate through each string in the input list 'lst'.
    3. For each string:
       a. Count the number of odd digits in the string.
       b. Create the output string by replacing all occurrences of 'i' with the count.
       c. Add the formatted string to the results list.
    4. Return the results list.

    Tips:
    - Use a loop to iterate through each character in a string.
    - To check if a digit is odd, convert it to an integer and use the modulo operator.
    - Use string formatting or replacement to create the output string.
