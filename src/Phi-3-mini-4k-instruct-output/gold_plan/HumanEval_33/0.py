def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]

    Action Plan:
    1. Create a copy of the input list 'l' to avoid modifying the original list.
    2. Extract elements at indices divisible by 3 (0, 3, 6, ...) into a separate list.
    3. Sort the extracted elements.
    4. Replace the elements at indices divisible by 3 in the copied list with the sorted elements.
    5. Return the modified list.

    Hints:
    - Use list slicing to access elements at indices divisible by 3: l[::3]
    - The sorted() function can be used to sort the extracted elements
    - List assignment with slicing can be used to replace elements at specific indices
