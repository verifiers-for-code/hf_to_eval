def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the letter grades.
    2. Iterate through each GPA in the input 'grades' list.
    3. For each GPA, use a series of conditional statements to determine the corresponding letter grade:
       a. Start with the highest GPA (4.0) and work your way down.
       b. Use 'if', 'elif', and 'else' statements to cover all possible GPA ranges.
       c. The conditions should check if the GPA is equal to or greater than the lower bound of each grade range.
    4. Append the determined letter grade to the output list.
    5. After processing all GPAs, return the list of letter grades.

    Note: Be careful with the boundary conditions, especially for 4.0 and 0.0 GPAs.
