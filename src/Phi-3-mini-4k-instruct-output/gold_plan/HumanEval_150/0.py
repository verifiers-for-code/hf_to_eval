def x_or_y(n, x, y):
    """A simple program which should return the value of x if n is
    a prime number and should return the value of y otherwise.

    Examples:
    for x_or_y(7, 34, 12) == 34
    for x_or_y(15, 8, 5) == 5

    Action Plan:
    1. Handle the special case:
       - Check if n is 1, which is not considered prime
       - If n is 1, return y

    2. Implement primality check:
       - Use a loop to iterate from 2 to n-1
       - In each iteration, check if n is divisible by the current number
       - If n is divisible by any number in this range, it's not prime
       - If a divisor is found, return y

    3. Handle the prime case:
       - If the loop completes without finding any divisors, n is prime
       - In this case, return x

    Note: Be careful with the loop implementation to ensure correct behavior
    for both prime and non-prime numbers.
