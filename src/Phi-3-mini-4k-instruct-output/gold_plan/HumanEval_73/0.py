def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of changes needed.
    2. Iterate through the first half of the array:
       a. Calculate the index for the current element from the start.
       b. Calculate the index for the corresponding element from the end.
       c. Compare the elements at these two indices.
       d. If they are different, increment the change counter.
    3. Return the total number of changes needed.

    Note: Remember that array indices start at 0, and you'll need to handle the case
    where the array length is odd correctly.
