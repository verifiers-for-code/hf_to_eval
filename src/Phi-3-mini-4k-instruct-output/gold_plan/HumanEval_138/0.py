    Example
    is_equal_to_sum_even(4) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(6) == False
    is_equal_to_sum_even(8) == True

    Action Plan:
    1. Check if the input number n is even.
       Hint: Use the modulo operator to check divisibility by 2.

    2. Determine the minimum possible sum of 4 positive even numbers.
       Think: What's the smallest positive even number? How many do we need?

    3. Check if n is greater than or equal to the minimum sum found in step 2.

    4. Combine the results from steps 1 and 3 using logical AND.

    5. Return the final result.

    Note: The key insight is that any even number greater than or equal to the
    minimum sum can be expressed as the sum of 4 positive even numbers.
