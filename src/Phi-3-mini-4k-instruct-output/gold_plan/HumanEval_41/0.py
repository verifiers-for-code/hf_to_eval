def car_race_collision(n: int):

    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.

    Action Plan:
    1. Understand the problem setup:
       - There are two sets of cars, each containing n cars.
       - One set moves left to right, the other right to left.
       - All cars move at the same speed.

    2. Analyze the collision pattern:
       - Each car from the left-to-right set will eventually meet every car from the right-to-left set.
       - The number of collisions is not affected by the cars continuing to move after colliding.

    3. Calculate the total number of collisions:
       - For each car in one set, count how many cars from the other set it will collide with.
       - Hint: Each car from one set will collide with all cars from the other set.

    4. Determine the mathematical representation:
       - Consider how to express the total number of collisions using the variable n.
       - Think about mathematical operations that involve n and result in the total number of collision pairs.

    5. Implement the calculation:
       - Write a simple expression using n that represents the total number of collisions.
       - Return this value as the function output.

    Remember: The solution should be concise and based on the mathematical relationship between n and the total number of collisions.
