def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty string to store the result.
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
        a. Check if the character is a letter using the `isalpha()` method.
        b. If the character is a letter:
            - Check if the character is uppercase using the `isupper()` method.
            - If uppercase, convert it to lowercase using the `lower()` method.
            - If lowercase, convert it to uppercase using the `upper()` method.
            - Add the modified character to the result string.
        c. If the character is not a letter:
            - Add the original character to the result string.
    3. After iterating through all characters, check if the result string is empty:
        a. If the result string is empty, it means no letters were found in the input string.
        b. In this case, reverse the entire input string using slicing (`s[::-1]`) and return the reversed string.
    4. Return the final result string.
    
    Note: Use the `isalpha()`, `isupper()`, and `lower()` methods to check and modify the case of letters.
    Be careful when handling non-letter characters and reversing the entire string."""
