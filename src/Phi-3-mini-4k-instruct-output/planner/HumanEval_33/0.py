def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the sorted values at indicies divisible by three.
    2. Iterate through the input list:
        a. Check if the current index is divisible by three.
        b. If it is, add the value at that index to the sorted list.
    3. Sort the values in the sorted list in ascending order.
    4. Create a new list by combining the original list with the sorted list.
    5. Return the new list, which has the same values as the original list at indicies not divisible by three, and the sorted values at indicies divisible by three.
    
    Note: Use appropriate list methods for sorting and combining lists.
    Be careful when iterating through the list to avoid index errors."""
