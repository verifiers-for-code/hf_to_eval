def minPath(grid, k):
    """
    Given a grid with N rows and N columns (N >= 2) and a positive integer k, 
    each cell of the grid contains a value. Every integer in the range [1, N * N]
    inclusive appears exactly once on the cells of the grid.

    You have to find the minimum path of length k in the grid. You can start
    from any cell, and in each step you can move to any of the neighbor cells,
    in other words, you can go to cells which share an edge with you current
    cell.
    Please note that a path A (of length k) is considered less than a path B (of length k) if
    after making the ordered lists of the values on the cells that A and B go
    through (let's call them lst_A and lst_B), lst_A is lexicographically less
    than lst_B, in other words, there exist an integer index i (1 <= i <= k)
    such that lst_A[i] < lst_B[i] and for any j (1 <= j < i) we have
    lst_A[j] = lst_B[j].
    It is guaranteed that the answer is unique.
    Return an ordered list of the values on the cells that the minimum path go through.

    Examples:

        Input: grid = [ [1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]], k = 3
        Output: [1, 2, 1]

        Input: grid = [ [5,9,3], [4,1,6], [7,8,2]], k = 1
        Output: [1]
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize variables to store the minimum path and its length.
    2. Define a recursive function `explore_path` to explore all possible paths from a given cell.
    3. In the `explore_path` function:
        a. Check if the current path length is equal to k.
        b. If so, update the minimum path and its length if the current path is lexicographically smaller.
        c. If the current path length is less than k, recursively explore neighboring cells.
        d. In each recursive call, append the current cell value to the path and move to the next cell.
    4. Call the `explore_path` function from the starting cell (0, 0).
    5. Return the minimum path and its length.
    
    Note: Implement the logic for moving to neighboring cells correctly, considering the grid boundaries.
    Be careful with the recursive function to avoid infinite loops."""
