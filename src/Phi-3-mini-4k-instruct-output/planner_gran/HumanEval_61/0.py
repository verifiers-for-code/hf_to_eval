def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "(" and ")".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("(")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("()")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("(()())")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing(")(()")
    False
    

    1. Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets
       - Create an empty list or use a suitable data structure to implement the stack
    
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
       a. If the character is an opening bracket "(":
          - Push the character onto the stack
       b. If the character is a closing bracket ")":
          - Check if the stack is empty
             - If empty, return False (no matching opening bracket)
          - Pop the top element from the stack (matching opening bracket)
    
    3. After processing all characters in the string:
       - Check if the stack is empty
          - If empty, return True (all opening brackets had matching closing brackets)
          - If not empty, return False (unmatched opening brackets)
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a suitable data structure (e.g., list) to implement the stack
    - Use a loop to iterate through the input string
    - Use conditional statements (if-else) to handle opening and closing brackets
    - Use the appropriate stack operations (push, pop) to maintain the stack
    - Ensure the function handles empty input strings correctly"""
