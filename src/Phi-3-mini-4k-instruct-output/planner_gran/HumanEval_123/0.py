def get_odd_collatz(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.

    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined
    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the 
    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of 
    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous
    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.

    Note: 
        1. Collatz(1) is [1].
        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.

    For example:
    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.
    
    Action Plan:
    1. Handle the input integer:
       - Check if the input is a positive integer
       - If not, raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message
    
    2. Initialize variables:
       - Create an empty list to store the odd numbers in the Collatz sequence
       - Initialize a variable to store the current number (set to the input integer)
    
    3. Generate the Collatz sequence:
       - Create a loop that continues until the current number reaches 1
       - Inside the loop:
         a. Check if the current number is odd
         b. If it's odd, append it to the list of odd numbers
         c. If it's even, divide it by 2
         d. Update the current number with the new value
    
    4. Sort the list of odd numbers:
       - Use the built-in sorted function to sort the list in increasing order
    
    5. Return the sorted list of odd numbers:
       - Return the sorted list as the result of the function
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a while loop to generate the Collatz sequence
    - Use the modulo operator (%) to check if a number is odd (num % 2!= 0)
    - Use the division operator (/) to divide an even number by 2
    - Use the append method to add odd numbers to the list
    - Use the sorted function to sort the list in increasing order
    - Consider adding a docstring to the function to provide documentation and examples
