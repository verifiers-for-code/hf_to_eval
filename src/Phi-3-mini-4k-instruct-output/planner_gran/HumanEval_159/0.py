def eat(number, need, remaining):
    """
    You're a hungry rabbit, and you already have eaten a certain number of carrots,
    but now you need to eat more carrots to complete the day's meals.
    you should return an array of [ total number of eaten carrots after your meals,
                                    the number of carrots left after your meals ]
    if there are not enough remaining carrots, you will eat all remaining carrots, but will still be hungry.
    
    Example:
    * eat(5, 6, 10) -> [11, 4]
    * eat(4, 8, 9) -> [12, 1]
    * eat(1, 10, 10) -> [11, 0]
    * eat(2, 11, 5) -> [7, 0]
    
    Variables:
    @number : integer
        the number of carrots that you have eaten.
    @need : integer
        the number of carrots that you need to eat.
    @remaining : integer
        the number of remaining carrots thet exist in stock
    
    Constrain:
    * 0 <= number <= 1000
    * 0 <= need <= 1000
    * 0 <= remaining <= 1000

    Have fun :)
    
    1. Understand the input parameters:
       - number: the number of carrots already eaten
       - need: the number of carrots needed to complete the day's meals
       - remaining: the number of remaining carrots in stock
    
    2. Calculate the total number of carrots eaten:
       - Add the number of carrots already eaten (number) to the number of carrots needed (need)
    
    3. Calculate the number of carrots left:
       - Subtract the total number of carrots eaten from the remaining carrots
       - Take the absolute value of the result to ensure it's non-negative
    
    4. Handle cases where there are not enough remaining carrots:
       - If the remaining carrots are less than the total number of carrots eaten, eat all remaining carrots
       - Set the number of carrots left to 0 in this case
    
    5. Return the result as an array:
       - Create an array with two elements: the total number of carrots eaten and the number of carrots left
       - Return this array as the result
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Ensure the function handles edge cases, such as when the input parameters are 0 or negative
    - Use appropriate variable names and comments to make the code readable and understandable
    - Consider adding input validation to ensure the input parameters are within the specified constraints
