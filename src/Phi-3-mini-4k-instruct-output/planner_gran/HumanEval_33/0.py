def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]

    1. Initialize an empty list to store the result
       - This list will hold the modified values from the input list
    
    2. Iterate through each index in the input list:
       a. Check if the current index is divisible by three
       b. If the index is divisible by three:
          - Sort the values in the input list at that index
          - Add the sorted value to the result list
       c. If the index is not divisible by three:
          - Add the original value from the input list to the result list
    
    3. After iterating through all indices:
       - Return the result list
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a loop to iterate through the indices of the input list
    - Use the modulus operator (%) to check if an index is divisible by three
    - Use list slicing or indexing to access the values at specific indices
    - Use the sorted() function to sort the values at indices divisible by three
    - Ensure that the function handles empty input lists correctly"""
