def solve(s):
    """You are given a string s.
    if s[i] is a letter, reverse its case from lower to upper or vise versa, 
    otherwise keep it as it is.
    If the string contains no letters, reverse the string.
    The function should return the resulted string.
    Examples
    solve("1234") = "4321"
    solve("ab") = "AB"
    solve("#a@C") = "#A@c"
    
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the processed characters
       - This list will hold the characters after applying the rules
    
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
       a. Check if the character is a letter (using the isalpha() method)
       b. If the character is a letter:
          - Reverse its case using the swapcase() method
          - Add the modified character to the list
       c. If the character is not a letter:
          - Add the original character to the list
    
    3. Convert the list of characters back into a string
       - Use the join() method to concatenate the characters
    
    4. Check if the resulting string is empty
       - If the string is empty, return the reversed original string
       - If the string is not empty, return the processed string
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a loop to iterate through the characters in the input string
    - Use the isalpha() method to check if a character is a letter
    - Use the swapcase() method to reverse the case of a letter
    - Use the join() method to convert the list of characters back into a string
    - Handle edge cases, such as an empty input string"""
