def triples_sum_to_zero(l: list):
    """
    triples_sum_to_zero takes a list of integers as an input.
    it returns True if there are three distinct elements in the list that
    sum to zero, and False otherwise.

    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, 5, 0])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 3, -2, 1])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1, 2, 3, 7])
    False
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([2, 4, -5, 3, 9, 7])
    True
    >>> triples_sum_to_zero([1])
    False
    

    1. Initialize the function with a list of integers as input
       - Define the function signature with a single parameter: a list of integers
    
    2. Iterate through each element in the input list:
       - Use a loop to process each element in the list
    
    3. For each element, calculate the sum of the element and its complement:
       - The complement is the negative of the current element
       - Calculate the sum of the element and its complement
    
    4. Check if the complement exists in the list (excluding the current element):
       - Use a list comprehension or a loop to check if the complement is in the list
       - Ensure that the complement is not the same as the current element
    
    5. If the complement is found, return True:
       - This indicates that there are three distinct elements that sum to zero
    
    6. If no complement is found after processing all elements, return False:
       - This indicates that there are no three distinct elements that sum to zero
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a conditional statement to check if the complement exists in the list
    - Consider using a set to store the complements for faster lookup
    - Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty input list or a list with only one element
