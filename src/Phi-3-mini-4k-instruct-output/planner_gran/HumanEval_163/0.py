def generate_integers(a, b):
    """
    Given two positive integers a and b, return the even digits between a
    and b, in ascending order.

    For example:
    generate_integers(2, 8) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(8, 2) => [2, 4, 6, 8]
    generate_integers(10, 14) => []
    

    1. Initialize an empty list to store the even digits
       - This list will hold the even digits between a and b
    
    2. Iterate through the range of numbers between a and b (inclusive)
       - Use a loop to iterate from a to b (inclusive)
    
    3. For each number in the range:
       a. Check if the number is even
          - Use the modulus operator (%) to check if the number is divisible by 2
       b. If the number is even:
          - Add the number to the list of even digits
    
    4. After iterating through the entire range, return the list of even digits
       - The list will contain all even digits between a and b, in ascending order
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a for loop to iterate through the range of numbers
    - Use the append method to add even numbers to the list
    - Ensure that the function handles cases where a is greater than b correctly
    - Consider adding input validation to ensure a and b are positive integers"""
