    You are given 2 words. You need to return True if the second word or any of its rotations is a substring in the first word.
    
    1. Initialize an empty list to store all possible rotations of the second word
       - This list will hold the rotations of the second word
    
    2. Generate all possible rotations of the second word:
       a. Use a loop to iterate over the characters of the second word
       b. For each character, create a new string by concatenating the characters before and after the current character
       c. Add the new string to the list of rotations
    
    3. Initialize a variable to track if a rotation is found
       - Set the variable to False initially
    
    4. Iterate over the list of rotations:
       a. Check if the current rotation is a substring in the first word
       b. If it is, set the variable to True and break the loop
       c. If not, continue to the next rotation
    
    5. Return the result:
       - If the variable is True, return True (a rotation is found)
       - If the variable is False, return False (no rotation found)
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use the appropriate string methods for concatenation, substring checking, and iteration
    - Consider using a more efficient approach for generating rotations, such as using slicing and concatenation
    - Ensure that the function handles empty input strings correctly
