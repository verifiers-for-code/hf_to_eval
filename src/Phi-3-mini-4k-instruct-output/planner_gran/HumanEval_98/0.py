def count_upper(s):
    """
    Given a string s, count the number of uppercase vowels in even indices.
    
    For example:
    count_upper('aBCdEf') returns 1
    count_upper('abcdefg') returns 0
    count_upper('dBBE') returns 0
    

    1. Define the list of vowels to check:
       - Create a list of uppercase vowels (e.g., 'AEIOU')
    
    2. Initialize a counter variable:
       - Set a variable (e.g., count) to 0 to store the count of uppercase vowels
    
    3. Iterate through the string with even indices:
       - Use a loop to iterate through the characters of the string, starting from the first character (index 0)
       - Use a conditional statement to ensure only even indices are processed (e.g., `i % 2 == 0`)
    
    4. Check if a character is uppercase and a vowel:
       - Use the `isupper()` method to check if the character is uppercase
       - Check if the uppercase character is in the list of vowels
    
    5. Increment the counter if the character meets the conditions:
       - If the character is uppercase and a vowel, increment the counter variable
    
    6. Return the count:
       - After iterating through the entire string, return the final count of uppercase vowels
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a for loop or enumerate to iterate through the string
    - Use the `in` operator to check if the uppercase character is in the list of vowels
    - Ensure the function handles empty input strings correctly
    - Consider adding input validation to handle non-string inputs
