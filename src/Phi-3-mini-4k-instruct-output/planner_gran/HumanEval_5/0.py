def intersperse(numbers: List[int], delimeter: int) -> List[int]:
    """
    Insert a number 'delimeter' between every two consecutive elements of input list `numbers`.
    
    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty list to store the result.
    2. Iterate over the input list of numbers.
    3. For each element, check if it's not the last element in the list.
       - If it's not the last element, append the delimiter to the result list.
       - This ensures that the delimiter is inserted between each pair of consecutive elements.
    4. Append the current element to the result list.
       - This adds the actual number to the result list.
    5. Repeat steps 3-4 until all elements in the input list have been processed.
    6. Return the resulting list.
       - The list now contains the input numbers with the delimiter inserted between each pair of consecutive elements.
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a for loop to iterate over the input list.
    - Use the append method to add elements to the result list.
    - Ensure that the function handles empty input lists correctly.
    - Consider adding type hints and a docstring to the function for clarity and documentation.
