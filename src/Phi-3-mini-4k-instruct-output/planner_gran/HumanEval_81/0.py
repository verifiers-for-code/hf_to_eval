def numerical_letter_grade(grades):
    """It is the last week of the semester and the teacher has to give the grades
    to students. The teacher has been making her own algorithm for grading.
    The only problem is, she has lost the code she used for grading.
    She has given you a list of GPAs for some students and you have to write 
    a function that can output a list of letter grades using the following table:
             GPA       |    Letter grade
              4.0                A+
            > 3.7                A 
            > 3.3                A- 
            > 3.0                B+
            > 2.7                B 
            > 2.3                B-
            > 2.0                C+
            > 1.7                C
            > 1.3                C-
            > 1.0                D+ 
            > 0.7                D 
            > 0.0                D-
              0.0                E
    

    Example:
    grade_equation([4.0, 3, 1.7, 2, 3.5]) ==> ['A+', 'B', 'C-', 'C', 'A-']
    

    1. Define the grading algorithm:
       - Create a dictionary to map GPA ranges to letter grades
       - Specify the GPA ranges and corresponding letter grades (A+, A, A-, B+, B, B-, C+, C, C-, D+, D, D-, E)
    
    2. Initialize an empty list to store the letter grades:
       - This list will hold the letter grades corresponding to each GPA in the input list
    
    3. Iterate through each GPA in the input list:
       - Use a loop to process each GPA individually
    
    4. For each GPA, determine the corresponding letter grade:
       - Use the grading algorithm (dictionary) to find the letter grade based on the GPA
       - Append the letter grade to the list of letter grades
    
    5. Return the list of letter grades:
       - After processing all GPAs, return the list of letter grades
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a conditional statement (if-elif-else) to handle the GPA ranges and assign the correct letter grade
    - Consider using a more efficient data structure, such as a list comprehension, to process the GPAs and assign letter grades
    - Ensure that the function handles invalid or missing GPAs correctly (e.g., raise an error or return a default value)"""
