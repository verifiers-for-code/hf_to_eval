def histogram(test):
    """Given a string representing a space separated lowercase letters, return a dictionary
    of the letter with the most repetition and containing the corresponding count.
    If several letters have the same occurrence, return all of them.
    
    Example:
    histogram('a b c') == {'a': 1, 'b': 1, 'c': 1}
    histogram('a b b a') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('a b c a b') == {'a': 2, 'b': 2}
    histogram('b b b b a') == {'b': 4}

    1. Initialize an empty dictionary to store the letter counts
       - This dictionary will hold the letters as keys and their counts as values
    
    2. Split the input string into a list of words
       - Use the appropriate string method to split the string into individual words
    
    3. Iterate through each word in the list:
       a. Iterate through each character in the word
       b. Check if the character is an alphabet letter (using the isalpha() method)
       c. If the character is an alphabet letter:
          - Check if the character is already in the letter counts dictionary
          - If it is, increment its count by 1
          - If not, add the character to the dictionary with a count of 1
    
    4. Find the maximum count in the letter counts dictionary
       - Use the appropriate dictionary method to find the maximum value
    
    5. Create a new dictionary to store the result
       - Initialize an empty dictionary to store the letter and its count
    
    6. Iterate through the letter counts dictionary:
       a. Check if the count of the current letter matches the maximum count
       b. If it does, add the letter and its count to the result dictionary
    
    7. Return the result dictionary
       - This dictionary will contain the letter with the most repetition and its count
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use the appropriate string and dictionary methods for splitting, iterating, and updating the dictionaries
    - Handle edge cases, such as an empty input string or a string with no alphabet letters
    - Consider using a collections.Counter object instead of a dictionary to simplify the implementation"""
