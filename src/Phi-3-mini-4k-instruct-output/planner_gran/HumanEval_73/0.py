def smallest_change(arr):
    """
    Given an array arr of integers, find the minimum number of elements that
    need to be changed to make the array palindromic. A palindromic array is an array that
    is read the same backwards and forwards. In one change, you can change one element to any other element.

    For example:
    smallest_change([1,2,3,5,4,7,9,6]) == 4
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 2]) == 1
    smallest_change([1, 2, 3, 2, 1]) == 0
    

    1. Initialize a 2D table (dp) to store the minimum changes for each subproblem:
       - The table will have dimensions n x n, where n is the length of the input array
       - dp[i][j] will represent the minimum number of changes needed to make the subarray from index i to j palindromic
    
    2. Initialize the diagonal elements of the table (dp[i][i]):
       - These elements represent subproblems of length 1, which are already palindromes
       - Initialize each diagonal element to 0, as no changes are needed
    
    3. Fill the table using a bottom-up approach:
       - Iterate over subproblems of increasing length (from 2 to n)
       - For each subproblem, consider all possible midpoints (from 0 to n//2)
       - Calculate the minimum number of changes needed to make the subarray from index i to j palindromic
       - Store the result in dp[i][j]
    
    4. For each subproblem, consider two cases:
       a. If the current elements at indices i and j are equal, no changes are needed
          - dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1]
       b. If the current elements at indices i and j are not equal, consider two options:
          - Change the element at index i to the element at index j
          - Change the element at index j to the element at index i
          - Calculate the minimum number of changes needed for each option
          - Store the result in dp[i][j]
    
    5. Return the minimum number of changes needed:
       - The minimum number of changes needed to make the entire array palindromic is stored in dp[0][n-1]
       - Return this value as the result
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a nested loop to iterate over subproblems and midpoints
    - Use conditional statements to handle the cases where the current elements are equal or not equal
    - Use the appropriate data structures and variables to store and update the minimum changes
    - Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty input array or an array with a single element"""
