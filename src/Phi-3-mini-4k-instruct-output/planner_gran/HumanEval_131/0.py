def digits(n):
    """Given a positive integer n, return the product of the odd digits.
    Return 0 if all digits are even.
    For example:
    digits(1)  == 1
    digits(4)  == 0
    digits(235) == 15
    
    1. Initialize a variable to store the product of odd digits
       - Set the initial value to 1, as the product of no odd digits is 1
    
    2. Extract individual digits from the input integer:
       - Use a loop to repeatedly divide the integer by 10 (using integer division)
       - In each iteration, extract the last digit of the current number (using the modulus operator)
    
    3. Check if the extracted digit is odd:
       - Use the modulus operator to check if the digit is odd (i.e., the remainder of the division by 2 is not 0)
    
    4. If the digit is odd, multiply the product by the digit:
       - Update the product variable with the new value
    
    5. Repeat steps 2-4 until all digits have been processed:
       - Continue the loop until the integer becomes 0
    
    6. Return the final product:
       - If the product is still 1, it means all digits were even, so return 0
       - Otherwise, return the calculated product
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a while loop to repeatedly extract digits until the integer becomes 0
    - Use the modulus operator (%) to extract the last digit of the current number
    - Use the floor division operator (//) to perform integer division
    - Consider adding input validation to ensure the input is a positive integer"""
