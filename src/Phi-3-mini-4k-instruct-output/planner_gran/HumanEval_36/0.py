    1. Initialize a counter variable to store the count of 7s
       - Set the counter to 0 initially
    
    2. Iterate over the numbers less than n (from 0 to n-1):
       a. Convert the current number to a string to easily access its digits
       b. Check if the number is divisible by 11 or 13:
          - Use the modulus operator (%) to check for divisibility
          - Use the logical OR operator (or) to combine the conditions
       c. If the number is divisible by 11 or 13:
          - Convert the string representation of the number to a list of digits
          - Use a generator expression or a loop to count the occurrences of the digit 7
          - Add the count to the counter variable
    
    3. After iterating over all numbers, return the final count of 7s
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a for loop to iterate over the numbers
    - Use the str() function to convert the number to a string
    - Use the int() function to convert the string back to an integer for the modulus operation
    - Use the count() method of the list to count the occurrences of 7
    - Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as n being 0 or a negative number"""
