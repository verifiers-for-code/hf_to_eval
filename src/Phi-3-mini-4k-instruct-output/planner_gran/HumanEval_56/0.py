def correct_bracketing(brackets: str):
    """ brackets is a string of "<" and ">".
    return True if every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.

    >>> correct_bracketing("<")
    False
    >>> correct_bracketing("<>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("<<><>>")
    True
    >>> correct_bracketing("><<>")
    False
    

    1. Initialize an empty stack to store opening brackets
       - This stack will keep track of the opening brackets encountered
    
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
       a. If the character is "<":
          - Push it onto the stack
       b. If the character is ">":
          - Check if the stack is empty
             - If empty, return False (no matching opening bracket)
          - Pop the top element from the stack (closing bracket)
    
    3. After iterating through the entire string:
       - Check if the stack is empty
          - If empty, return True (all opening brackets have matching closing brackets)
          - If not empty, return False (unmatched opening brackets remain)
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a suitable data structure (e.g., list or deque) to implement the stack
    - Implement the iteration using a loop (e.g., for loop)
    - Use conditional statements (e.g., if-else) to handle the different cases
    - Ensure the function handles empty input strings correctly"""
