def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    

    1. Understand the problem's parameters:
       - The function takes an integer `n` as input, representing the number of cars in each direction
       - The cars move at the same speed in opposite directions
    
    2. Initialize variables:
       - `left_cars` to track the number of cars moving left to right
       - `right_cars` to track the number of cars moving right to left
       - `collisions` to store the total number of collisions
    
    3. Simulate the movement of cars:
       - Use a loop that continues until `left_cars` becomes 0 or `right_cars` becomes 0
       - In each iteration:
         a. Check if there are cars moving left to right (i.e., `left_cars > 0`)
         b. If there are, decrement `left_cars` by 1
         c. Check if there are cars moving right to left (i.e., `right_cars > 0`)
         d. If there are, decrement `right_cars` by 1
         e. Increment `collisions` by 1 if both conditions are true
    
    4. Return the total number of collisions:
       - After the loop finishes, return the value of `collisions`
    
    Additional implementation details:
    - Use a while loop to simulate the movement of cars
    - Use conditional statements (if-else) to check for collisions and update the car counts
    - Ensure that the function handles edge cases, such as `n` being 0 or negative
    - Consider adding comments or docstrings to explain the logic and purpose of the code
