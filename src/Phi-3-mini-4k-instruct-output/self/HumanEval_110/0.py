def exchange(lst1, lst2):
    """In this problem, you will implement a function that takes two lists of numbers,
    and determines whether it is possible to perform an exchange of elements
    between them to make lst1 a list of only even numbers.
    There is no limit on the number of exchanged elements between lst1 and lst2.
    If it is possible to exchange elements between the lst1 and lst2 to make
    all the elements of lst1 to be even, return "YES".
    Otherwise, return "NO".
    For example:
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 3, 4]) => "YES"
    exchange([1, 2, 3, 4], [1, 5, 3, 4]) => "NO"
    It is assumed that the input lists will be non-empty.
    
    Action Plan:
    1. Define a helper function to determine if a number is even:
        a. Check if the number is divisible by 2
    
    2. Determine the number of even numbers in lst1 and lst2:
        a. Use list comprehensions to filter out even numbers in each list
        b. Store the results
    
    3. Analyze possible exchange scenarios:
        a. Compare the number of even numbers in both lists
        b. If the numbers of even elements are equal in both lists, it's potentially possible to exchange.
    
    4. Assess if exchanges are feasible:
        a. For equal even counts, iterate through the lists, attempting exchanges between even numbers in lst1 and lst2
        b. Keep track of the exchanged elements to ensure they don't duplicate
    
    5. Conclusion:
        a. If at least one valid exchange is found to make lst1 even, return "YES"
        b. If no valid exchange found, return "NO"
    
    6. Additional considerations:
        a. Account for edge cases, like when lst1 is entirely even or entirely odd
        b. Consider the possibility of exchanges only between two even numbers, or one odd and one even number (and if these combinations are allowable)"""
