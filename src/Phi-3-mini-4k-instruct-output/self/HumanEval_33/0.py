def sort_third(l: list):
    """This function takes a list l and returns a list l' such that
    l' is identical to l in the indicies that are not divisible by three, while its values at the indicies that are divisible by three are equal
    to the values of the corresponding indicies of l, but sorted.
    >>> sort_third([1, 2, 3])
    [1, 2, 3]
    >>> sort_third([5, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 2])
    [2, 6, 3, 4, 8, 9, 5]
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Identify indices divisible by three:
        - Use list comprehension with enumerate() to separate divisible indices
    
    2. Separate values into two lists:
        - Create one list for values at indices divisible by three
        - Create another list for values at indices not divisible by three
    
    3. Sort the values at indices divisible by three:
        - Sort the second list using built-in sorting methods
    
    4. Merge both lists while preserving order and position:
        - Iterate through the first list, placing sorted values from the second list at their correct positions
    
    5. Edge case handling:
        - If the list is empty, return an empty list
        - If no indices are divisible by three, return the original list
        - If all indices are divisible by three, sort the values and return the new list
    
    6. Optimization:
        - Avoid modifying the lists during iteration if possible
    
    7. Test with given examples and potential edge cases"""
