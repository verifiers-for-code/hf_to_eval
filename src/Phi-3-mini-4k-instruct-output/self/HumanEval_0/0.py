    Action Plan:
    1. Set up outer and inner loops to iterate through the list of numbers.
    2. Inside the inner loop, compare the current number with each number in the remaining part of the list.
    3. Ensure the inner loop only starts at the index after the current number in the outer loop to avoid redundant comparisons and avoiding the case of self-comparison.
    4. Within each inner loop iteration, calculate the absolute difference between the current number and the number in the inner loop.
    5. Implement a boolean flag to track if a pair that meets the condition is found.
    6. After finishing the loops, return the boolean flag indicating the presence or absence of a close pair."""
