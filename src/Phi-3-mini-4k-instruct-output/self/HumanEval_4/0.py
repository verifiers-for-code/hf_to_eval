    """
    For a given list of input numbers, calculate Mean Absolute Deviation
    around the mean of this dataset.
    Mean Absolute Deviation is the average absolute difference between each
    element and a centerpoint (mean in this case):
    MAD = average | x - x_mean |
    
    Action Plan:
    1. Calculate the mean of the input list:
        a. Sum all elements using `sum()`
        b. Divide by the length of the list to get the mean
    
    2. Create a new list with absolute differences:
        a. Use a list comprehension to iterate through the input list
        b. For each element, calculate its absolute difference from the mean
    
    3. Calculate the mean of the absolute differences:
        a. Sum the absolute differences using `sum()`
        b. Divide by the number of elements to get the Mean Absolute Deviation
    
    4. Edge cases to handle:
        a. An empty list should return 0.0
        b. Ensure there's at least one number in the list to avoid division by zero
    
    5. Optimization considerations:
        a. Keep track of the sum and count of elements while iterating to avoid additional iterations
    
    6. Testing:
        a. Confirm that the function returns correct results for given test cases
        b. Consider corner cases and random inputs with large numbers, and small numbers
