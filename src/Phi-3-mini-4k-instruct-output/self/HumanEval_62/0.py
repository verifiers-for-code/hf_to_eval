def derivative(xs: list):
    """ xs represent coefficients of a polynomial.
    xs[0] + xs[1] * x + xs[2] * x^2 + ....
     Return derivative of this polynomial in the same form.
    >>> derivative([3, 1, 2, 4, 5])
    [1, 4, 12, 20]
    >>> derivative([1, 2, 3])
    [2, 6]
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Start with an empty list `derivative_coeffs` to store the coefficients of the polynomial's derivative.
    2. Loop through the coefficients list using `enumerate(xs)` to access each coefficient and its index.
    3. Within the loop, compute the derivative coefficient by multiplying the current coefficient `xs[i]` by its power `(i + 1)`.
    4. Append the calculated derivative coefficient to the `derivative_coeffs` list.
    5. After the loop, return the `derivative_coeffs` list.
    
    6. Edge case handling:
       - If the input list `xs` has less than two elements, return an empty list as it represents a polynomial of degree 0 or less, which has no derivative.
    
    7. Example verification:
       - For `xs = [3, 1, 2, 4, 5]`, the output should be `[1, 4, 12, 20]` since the derivative of \(3x^4 + x^3 + 2x^2 + 4x + 5\) is \(12x^3 + 12x^2 + 8x + 4\).
       - For `xs = [1, 2, 3]`, the output should be `[2, 6]`, representing the derivative of \(x^2 + 2x + 3\) as \(2x + 6\).
    
    By following these steps, the AI can structure the logic for the `derivative` function and guide its implementation without providing the complete solution."""
