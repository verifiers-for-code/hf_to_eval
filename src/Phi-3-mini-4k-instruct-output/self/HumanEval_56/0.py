    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize an empty stack or list to keep track of opening brackets.
    2. Iterate through each character in the input string:
        a. If a character is an opening bracket ("<"), add it to the stack.
        b. If a character is a closing bracket (">"), check if it corresponds to the last opening bracket.
        c. If the stack is empty or the corresponding opening bracket doesn't match, return False.
    3. After the iteration, if the stack is empty, all brackets were properly matched and return True.
    4. If the stack is not empty, there are unpaired opening brackets and return False.
    5. Edge cases to consider:
        a. Empty strings
        b. Strings with no brackets
        c. Strings with only opening or only closing brackets
    
    6. For additional validations, check that the string contains only "<" and ">" characters."""
