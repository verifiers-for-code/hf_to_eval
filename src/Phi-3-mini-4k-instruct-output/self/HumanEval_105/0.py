def by_length(arr):
    """
    Given an array of integers, sort the integers that are between 1 and 9 inclusive,
    reverse the resulting array, and then replace each digit by its corresponding name from
    "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine".

    For example:
      arr = [2, 1, 1, 4, 5, 8, 2, 3]   
            -> sort arr -> [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8] 
            -> reverse arr -> [8, 5, 4, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
      return ["Eight", "Five", "Four", "Three", "Two", "Two", "One", "One"]
    
      If the array is empty, return an empty array:
      arr = []
      return []
    
      If the array has any strange number ignore it:
      arr = [1, -1 , 55] 
            -> sort arr -> [-1, 1, 55]
            -> reverse arr -> [55, 1, -1]
      return = ['One']
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Implement a helper function to filter and sort the relevant numbers, then reverse the list:
        - Extract the numbers between 1 and 9
        - Sort them, then reverse the resulting list
    
    2. Develop a helper function to replace each number in the list with its corresponding name:
        - Create a dictionary mapping integers 1-9 to "One" to "Nine"
        - Convert each element of the filtered and reversed list to its name using the dictionary
    
    3. In the main function, combine the two helper functions:
        - First, apply the first helper to get the modified list
        - Then, use the second helper to replace the digits with names
    
    4. Account for edge cases by:
        - Returning an empty list for an empty input
        - Checking each element to ensure it is an integer between 1 and 9 before processing
        - Skipping elements that don't meet the criteria
    
    5. Maintain efficiency by:
        - Using list comprehensions to reduce code complexity
        - Ensuring dictionary keys align with the expected input range"""
