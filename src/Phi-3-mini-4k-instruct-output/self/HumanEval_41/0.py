def car_race_collision(n: int):
    """
    Imagine a road that's a perfectly straight infinitely long line.
    n cars are driving left to right;  simultaneously, a different set of n cars
    are driving right to left.   The two sets of cars start out being very far from
    each other.  All cars move in the same speed.  Two cars are said to collide
    when a car that's moving left to right hits a car that's moving right to left.
    However, the cars are infinitely sturdy and strong; as a result, they continue moving
    in their trajectory as if they did not collide.

    This function outputs the number of such collisions.
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Initialize a count for collisions and set of cars moving from each set
    
    2. Create a loop for the cars moving from the left set, tracking their current position
    
    3. Create a loop for the cars moving from the right set, tracking their current position
    
    4. For each pair of cars, check if they are close enough to collide
    
    5. Increment the collision count if a collision occurs
    
    6. Optimize the process by tracking only nearby cars and skipping pairs that can't collide
    
    7. Output the final count of collisions"""
