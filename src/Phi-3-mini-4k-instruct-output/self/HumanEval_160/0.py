def do_algebra(operator, operand):
    """
    Given two lists operator, and operand. The first list has basic algebra operations, and 
    the second list is a list of integers. Use the two given lists to build the algebric 
    expression and return the evaluation of this expression.

    The basic algebra operations:
    Addition ( + ) 
    Subtraction ( - ) 
    Multiplication ( * ) 
    Floor division ( // ) 
    Exponentiation ( ** ) 

    Example:
    operator['+', '*', '-']
    array = [2, 3, 4, 5]
    result = 2 + 3 * 4 - 5
    => result = 9

    Note:
        The length of operator list is equal to the length of operand list minus one.
        Operand is a list of of non-negative integers.
        Operator list has at least one operator, and operand list has at least two operands.

    

    Action Plan:
    1. Validate input:
        - Check the length of operator list and operand list
        - Ensure that the lists meet the specified conditions
    
    2. Create the expression string:
        - Iterate through both lists simultaneously, appending elements to form the expression
        - Take care of precedence and parentheses; for this simpler example, just concatenate as strings
    
    3. Evaluate the expression:
        - Use Python's `eval()` function with an additional `locals` dictionary to handle operations from the `operator` list
        - Ensure that the environment for `eval()` only contains numbers and the operations from the `operator` list to avoid security risks
    
    4. Consider additional features if possible:
        - Support parentheses for changing precedence
        - Handle more complex expressions with brackets
    
    5. Testing:
        - Use the provided example and additional test cases to verify the correctness of the implementation
