def make_a_pile(n):
    """
    Given a positive integer n, you have to make a pile of n levels of stones.
    The first level has n stones.
    The number of stones in the next level is:
        - the next odd number if n is odd.
        - the next even number if n is even.
    Return the number of stones in each level in a list, where element at index
    i represents the number of stones in the level (i+1).

    Examples:
    >>> make_a_pile(3)
    [3, 5, 7]
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Identify the base case:
        - When n equals 1, return the list containing only n
    
    2. Create a loop that iterates from the second level to n levels:
        a. Determine if n is odd or even
        b. Update the number of stones in the current level based on the parity of n:
            - If n is odd, use the next odd number
            - If n is even, use the next even number
        c. Append the number of stones to the list representing the pile levels
    
    3. Iteration logic:
        a. Starting from level 1, initialize the list and the current stone count
        b. For each level, check if the current number of stones follows the odd/even rule and add it to the list
        c. Adjust the current stone count to the next odd or even number accordingly
    
    4. Edge cases:
        a. Handle the case where n equals 1, as it is a special scenario
        b. Consider possible data type issues and handle them gracefully
    
    5. Optimization:
        - Keep track of the current odd or even number, avoiding redundant calculations
    
    6. Test the function:
        - Verify against the given examples and test additional edge cases, such as very large values of n or negative numbers"""
