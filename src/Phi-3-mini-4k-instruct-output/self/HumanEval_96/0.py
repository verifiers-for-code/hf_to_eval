def count_up_to(n):
    """Implement a function that takes a non-negative integer and returns an array of the first n
    integers that are prime numbers and less than n.
    for example:
    count_up_to(5) => [2,3]
    count_up_to(11) => [2,3,5,7]
    count_up_to(0) => []
    count_up_to(20) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19]
    count_up_to(1) => []
    count_up_to(18) => [2,3,5,7,11,13,17]
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Implement a helper function to check for primality:
        a. Return True if the input number is 2 (since 2 is the only even prime number) or check divisibility from 2 to the square root of the input number
        b. Return False if a divisor is found
    
    2. In the main function count_up_to():
        a. Initialize an empty list to store prime numbers
        b. Iterate through the range 2 to n inclusive
        c. If the number is prime (use the helper function), append it to the list
        d. Continue until the list has n elements or the current number exceeds n
    
    3. Edge cases to handle:
        a. If n is 0, return an empty list
        b. If n is 1, return [2], as 2 is the only prime number less than 1
        c. If n is greater than the maximum possible prime number within the range, return all prime numbers less than n
    
    4. Optimization:
        a. Avoid unnecessary checks for even numbers beyond 2
        b. Stop checking for divisibility once reaching the square root of a number
    
    5. Using Python's list comprehension and the enumerate() function could make the implementation concise and readable."""
