    Action Plan:
    1. Direct the model to create a list comprehension that filters the input list:
        a. Use a condition within the list comprehension to select only positive numbers
    
    2. Ensure that zero is also considered a positive number if it's desired
    
    3. Instruct the model to handle edge cases:
        a. An empty list should return an empty list
        b. Include checks for various number ranges and types (e.g., floats, integers)
    
    4. Provide guidance on testing:
        a. Test with different lists, including empty lists, lists with positive numbers only, lists with negative numbers, and lists with zeros
    
    5. Optimization pointers (if necessary):
        a. The list comprehension is already efficient and readable; however, exploring alternative filtering methods (e.g., filter() function) could be considered for educational purposes."""

    # This is already handled by the list comprehension as it works with any numeric type
