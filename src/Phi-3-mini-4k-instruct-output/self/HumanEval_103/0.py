def rounded_avg(n, m):
    """You are given two positive integers n and m, and your task is to compute the
    average of the integers from n through m (including n and m). 
    Round the answer to the nearest integer and convert that to binary.
    If n is greater than m, return -1.
    Example:
    rounded_avg(1, 5) => "0b11"
    rounded_avg(7, 5) => -1
    rounded_avg(10, 20) => "0b1111"
    rounded_avg(20, 33) => "0b11010"
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Input validation:
        a. Check if `n` <= `m`
        b. If not, return -1
    
    2. Compute the sum of integers from `n` to `m`:
        a. Initialize sum as 0
        b. Loop through integers from `n` to `m` (inclusive)
        c. Add each integer to sum
    
    3. Calculate the average:
        a. Compute the count of integers by subtracting `n` from `m` and adding 1
        b. Divide the sum by the count to get the average
    
    4. Round the average:
        a. Apply rounding function to get the nearest integer
    
    5. Convert the integer to binary:
        a. Use a function to convert the rounded average to a binary string
    
    6. Edge cases and efficiency considerations:
        a. Test with `n` > `m` to ensure the correct -1 response
        b. Consider optimizations for sum calculation and rounding
    
    7. Test with provided examples to validate the solution and handle any unforeseen cases."""
