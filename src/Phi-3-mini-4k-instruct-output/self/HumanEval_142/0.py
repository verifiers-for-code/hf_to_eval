def sum_squares(lst):
    """
    This function will take a list of integers. For all entries in the list, the function shall square the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 3 and will cube the integer entry if its index is a multiple of 4 and not a multiple of 3. The function will not change the entries in the list whose indexes are not a multiple of 3 or 4. The function shall then return the sum of all entries.
    
    Examples:
    For lst = [1,2,3] the output should be 6
    For lst = []  the output should be 0
    For lst = [-1,-5,2,-1,-5]  the output should be -126
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Set up list comprehension:
        - Use a list comprehension to iterate through the original list.
        - Within the comprehension, check the index's divisibility by 3 and 4 to apply the correct mathematical operation.
    
    2. Create a new list with transformed values:
        - Apply squaring or cubing as per conditions or keep the original value as per index.
    
    3. Sum the values from the new list to get the final output.
    
    4. Include checks for edge cases:
        - An empty list should result in a sum of 0.
        - Consider a single-element list, where the original element becomes the output.
    
    5. Validate the operations for negative indices, if required, and ensure no arithmetic issues occur.
