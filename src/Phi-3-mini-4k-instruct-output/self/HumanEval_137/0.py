def compare_one(a, b):
    """
    Create a function that takes integers, floats, or strings representing
    real numbers, and returns the larger variable in its given variable type.
    Return None if the values are equal.
    Note: If a real number is represented as a string, the floating point might be . or ,

    compare_one(1, 2.5) ➞ 2.5
    compare_one(1, "2,3") ➞ "2,3"
    compare_one("5,1", "6") ➞ "6"
    compare_one("1", 1) ➞ None
    

    Action Plan:
    1. Start by checking if both inputs are of the same type
       - If they're not, compare their type precedence to determine which one is larger
       - If they're the same type, proceed with numerical comparison
    
    2. For comparisons involving the same type (integer or float):
       - Cast both inputs to float for a uniform comparison
       - Use built-in comparison operators to determine the larger value
    
    3. Handle the string cases, which represent real numbers with a separator
       - Remove the separator (either ' or ',') from the string representation
       - Compare the floats for the string representations after the cleanup
    
    4. Edge cases to consider:
       - Zero as the larger value
       - String comparisons as the primary route when numbers cannot be compared directly
       - Comparisons between integers and floats
    
    5. Finally, return None if both values are equal, otherwise, return the larger value
    
    6. Incorporate informative and maintainable code with comments where appropriate"""
